# OAMC

This project aims to facilitate the _optimal additive manufacturing of (continuous-fiber) composites_ (OAMC) by providing various path planning algorithms. These algorithms utilize FEA results and therefore take loads and constraints into account. In addition, the user will be able to specify optimization objectives such as weight or compliance.

One subpackage (`oamc.lpp`) is based on Garth Pearce's [load path plotter](https://github.com/GarthPearce/LoadPathMATLAB/) but faster and more flexible (with support for tetrahedral and quadratic elements, for example). The generated load paths may be used directly for 3D printing or to initialize a gradient-based optimization algorithm (yet to be implemented).

This project is part of my BSc thesis at TUM.

## Current Limitations

FEA and hence gradient-based optimization are only available for single-body parts. The load path plotter also works with multi-body parts if the stress values at the nodes are pre-computed and exported from Ansys, for example.

## Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

## Changes

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Conventions

Node and element indices are converted from 1-based to 0-based indexing upon import.

Strains and stresses are stored in standard Voigt notation `[X, Y, Z, YZ, XZ, XY]` and engineering shear strain convention (twice the tensorial shear strains to keep the strain energy density consistent between vector and tensor notations). Utility functions may offer multiple conventions, but engineering is always the default.

## Notes on APDL

You may find these helpful when working with auto-generated APDL scripts such as ds.dat files.

- `keyo` and `keyop` are shortcuts for `KEYOPT`
- `cid` means "contact element type ID"
- `tid` means "target element type ID"
